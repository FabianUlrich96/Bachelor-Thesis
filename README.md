# Comparing the Code Quality of Multi-Lingual StackOverflow Communities

All files in this readme are listed in the order they got used for the creation of the methodology part of the thesis. 

## Thresholds

### com_Queries / ru_Queries:
SQL queries used to extract data using the Google BigQuery and the Stack Exchange Data Explorer.

### split_tags.py use-case: 
Requirements:
- package pandas

Reads a csv file with all tags from the posts which include at least one of the initial tags and splits the tags into one tag per row. In addition a copy of that results with only unique tags will be saved.

### count_total.py use-case:
Requirements:
- package pandas

Counts the total amount of times a tag got used in the input csv file. 

### TST_TRT_Evaluation_com / TST_TRT_Evaluation_ru:
Excel calculation file to evaluate the used tags after setting a threshold.


## Database Connection

### DataBaseConnection.py use-case:
Requirements:
- package sqlite3
- package pandas

General file to handle selects and saves to the in the file specified database.

## Select Code

### answer_code.py use-case:
Requirements:
- package re
- package pandas

Select snippets from answers with the pattern <code> ... </code> from the previously downloaded BigQuery request/ Stack Exchange Data Explorer request (code snippets are saved with that XML-markup in the Stack Exchange Database structure).
Save the results to a database. 

### answer_code_lenghts.py use-case:
Remove all single line answer code snippets. 

### question_code.py use-case:
Requirements:
- package re
- package pandas

Select snippets from questions with the pattern <code> ... </code> from the previously downloaded BigQuery request/ Stack Exchange Data Explorer request (code snippets are saved with that XML-markup in the Stack Exchange Database structure).
Save the results to a database.

### question_code_lenghts.py use-case:
Remove all single line question code snippets. 

## Language Classification

### SQL_training

SQL queries used to extract code snippets for training the classifier. 

### LangClassifier.py use-case:

Class to classify the code snippet with a Bayesian Classifier using the java_training.java and kotlin_training.kt training files.

### bayesian.py use-case:
Requirements:
- package pandas

Comparing the classification probabilities from the results of the LangClassifier class and returning a cleaned dataset to the classify_answer.py and classifiy_question.py files to save in the database.

### classify_answer.py use-case:

Interface to request answers from the DataBaseConnection class, request a programming language classification from the LangClassifier class, order and compare the results in the bayesian.py file and save the results to the database.

### classifiy_question.py use-case:

Interface to request questions from the DataBaseConnection class, request a programming language classification from the LangClassifier class, order and compare the results in the bayesian.py file and save the results to the database.

## Update Code Snippet

### java_update_code.py use-case:
Requirements:
- package pandas
Each Java code snippet need a class as a minimum requirement to run. Therefore this python file wraps the code snippet with a class if non of the trigger words is included in the snippet.
Trigger words:
- import 
- package
- class

### kotlin_update_code.py use-case:
Requirements:
- package pandas

Each Kotlin code snippet needs a main function as a minimum requirement to run. Therefore this python file adds a "fun main{}" to the beginning of the snippet if no "fun main" can be found.

## Cyclomatic Complexity Code
### complexity_answer.py use-case:
Interface that requests the answer selects from the DataBaseConnection class, requests a cyclomatic complexity result from the CyclomaticComplexityClass and saves the results to the database. 
### complexity_question.py use-case:
Interface that requests the question selects from the DataBaseConnection class, requests a cyclomatic complexity result from the CyclomaticComplexityClass and saves the results to the database. 

### CyclomaticComplexityClass.py use-case:
Requirements:
- package pandas

The cyclomatic complexity of a code snippet is assigned to 1 if non of the trigger words is included in the snippet. Each included trigger word increases the complexity by 1.
Trigger words:
- if
- else
- while
- for
- else if
- case with each -> in a case increasing it by 1

## Code Conventions

### checkstyle.py use-case:
Requirements:
- package subprocess
- package pandas
- package datatime
- package multiprocess
- package time

Executes the checkstyle-8.35all.jar in a commandline, searches for observed errors and saves the results to the database. 

### kt_lint.py use-case:
Requirements:
- package subprocess
- package pandas
- ktlint cmd tool: https://ktlint.github.io/

Executes the ktlint cmd tool, searches for the observed errors and saves the results to the database. 

## User Intersection

### get_user_data.py use-case:
Requirements: 
- package pandas
- package sqlite3

Request user id's from the stackoverflow.ru database, request the user profiles from the GetUserData class and save the results in the database.
### GetUserData.py use-case:
Requirements:
- package BeautifulSoup
- package get
- package time

Webscrape the user profiles from the ru.stackoverflow page and search if the user has a stackoverflow.com profile as well.
